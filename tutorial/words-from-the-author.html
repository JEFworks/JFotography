    <h1>Words from the author</h1>

    <hr>

    The goal of this e-book is not necessarily to make you a phenomenal photographer though you may choose to make that your personal goal if you wish. The goal of this book is to simply inspire an attitude of self learning and self education. The internet has become a goldmine of information and resources. If you want to do something and have the capacity to teach yourself how to do it, then you can accomplish just about anything.
    <br><br>
    The alternative goal of this e-book is to spread a general philosophy of free knowledge. This e-book is provided to you for free in the hopes that you may also take what you've learned either from this e-book or from elsewhere in life and pass that knowledge freely on to others.
    <br><br>
    Learn willingly. Teach generously. Thanks for reading.
    <br><br>
